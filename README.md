# IPv6 Tech Talk: Restoring end-to-end connectivity with IPv6

---

Presentation I gave for students at my school regarding the shortcomings of IPv4 NATs and end-to-end connectivity using IPv6.

The presentation is built using Hugo and Reveal.js. It can be presented by running `hugo server`.

An PDF exported version of the slides using `Decktape` is available in `slides.pdf`.
